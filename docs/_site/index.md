# Terraform Switcher 

Often times, we work with different versions
of terraform for multiple projects. The tfswitch 
command lets you switch different versions of the terraform installation on your computer. The installation is minimal and
easy. Simply select the version you require from the dropdown and 
start using terraform with ease.
