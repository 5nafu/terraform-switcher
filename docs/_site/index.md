# Terraform Switcher 

The `tfswitch` command line tool lets you switch between different versions of [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/){:target="_blank"}. 
If you do not have a particular version of terraform installed, `tfswitch` will download the version you desire.
The installation is minimal and easy. 
Once installed, simply select the version you require from the dropdown and start using terraform.
